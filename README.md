# Delivero Universal CI/CD

Delivero is a universal, repository-agnostic CI/CD workflow built for GitHub Actions. It allows you to define your project's build, test, artifact, and notification steps in a simple `delivero.yaml` file. Delivero handles cloning your project, running builds/tests, uploading artifacts to S3-compatible storage (we recommend Wasabi S3, which offers a free 30-day trial), and sending notifications (e.g., WhatsApp via CallMeBot) â€” all triggered automatically every 15 minutes or on-demand.

## Features

- **Repo-Agnostic:** Works with any repo by specifying it in `delivero.yaml`
- **Scheduled CI/CD:** Checks for new commits every 15 minutes; only builds when there are updates
- **Pluggable Build/Test Steps:** Define shell commands for building and testing
- **Artifact Upload:** Store build artifacts in S3-compatible storage
- **Pre-Signed Links:** Get downloadable links to your artifacts
- **Notifications:** Receive WhatsApp alerts when builds complete
- **Simple YAML Configuration:** One file to rule them all

## Getting Started

### 1. Fork or Clone This Repository

This repository houses the workflow and the example configuration.

### 2. Copy `delivero.example.yaml` to Your Project

Rename it to `delivero.yaml` and customize the fields for your project (see below).

### 3. Setup GitHub Secrets

Add these secrets to your repository (or organization) settings:

- `S3_ENDPOINT`
- `S3_ACCESS_KEY`
- `S3_SECRET_KEY`
- `S3_BUCKET`
- `CALLMEBOT_APIKEY` (for WhatsApp notifications)

### 4. Example `delivero.yaml`

````yaml
name: Example Project

repo: https://github.com/your-user/your-repo.git
repo_dir: app

dependencies:
  linux:
    - sudo apt update
    - sudo apt install -y curl git unzip xz-utils zip libglu1-mesa
    - curl -O https://storage.googleapis.com/flutter_infra_release/releases/stable/linux/flutter_linux_3.22.1-stable.tar.xz
    - tar xf flutter_linux_3.22.1-stable.tar.xz
    - export PATH="$PATH:$(pwd)/flutter/bin"

build:
  - echo "Starting build"
  - make build

test:
  - echo "Running tests"
  - make test

artifacts:
  - path: dist/app.apk
    name: app.apk
  - path: reports/coverage.html
    name: coverage.html

storage:
  provider: s3
  bucket: my-artifacts

notify:
  channels:
    - type: whatsapp
      phone: "+15555555555"
      provider: callmebot
````

### 5. Workflow File

The workflow (`.github/workflows/delivero.yml`) is already set up to:

- Clone the repo defined in your `delivero.yaml`
- Run build and test steps
- Upload artifacts to S3
- Generate pre-signed download links
- Notify via WhatsApp

You can run the workflow manually or let it run every 15 minutes.

## How It Works

1. Every 15 minutes, the workflow checks for new commits in your target repo.
2. If commits are found, it:
   - Clones the target repo and enters the specified directory.
   - Executes build and test commands.
   - Uploads artifacts to your S3 bucket.
   - Generates pre-signed download links for the artifacts.
   - Sends a WhatsApp notification with the links.

## Customization

- **Add/Remove build or test steps:** Edit the `build` and `test` arrays in `delivero.yaml`.
- **Artifacts:** List any files you want to upload in the `artifacts` array.
- **Notifications:** Add new channels as needed (e.g., Slack, Discord).
- **Dependencies:** Use the `dependencies: linux:` section in `delivero.yaml` to define any system-level dependencies required for your project. These commands will be executed before the build and test steps. For example:
  - Install required packages (e.g., `sudo apt install -y curl git`).
  - Download and configure tools (e.g., Flutter SDK, Node.js, etc.).

## S3 Storage Recommendation

We recommend using Wasabi S3 for your storage needs. Wasabi offers:
- Free 30-day trial
- S3-compatible API
- Lower costs compared to AWS S3
- No egress fees

To get started with Wasabi S3, visit [wasabi.com](https://wasabi.com) and sign up for a free trial.

## Troubleshooting

- Make sure all required secrets are set in your repository.
- Ensure your S3 service is accessible and the credentials are correct.
- WhatsApp notifications require a valid CallMeBot API key and a registered phone number.
